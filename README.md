- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @abuarquee
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate at the Physics Institute of Federal University of Alagoas in MaceiÃ³, Brazil. 
For the past few years, I have been dealing with many topics on quantum walks, 
correlated particles and quantum information processing in the most varied scenarios, that includes disordered systems, 
action of external fields and nonlinear effects. 
My current research focuses on the study of the properties of transport and quantum entanglement using the discrete-time quantum walk protocol. 
Until now, I have developed strong skills in theoretical and computational fields.

Areas of interest:
Quantum walks; Quantum information processing in solid-state systems; Complex networks; Correlated particles; Transport properties in nanostructured systems.
